# AI-Driven Patch Optimization Engine

An intelligent vulnerability patch prioritization system that:

- Predicts contextual vulnerability risk using Machine Learning
- Explains model decisions using SHAP (Explainable AI)
- Optimizes patching decisions using constrained optimization (0/1 Knapsack)
- Maximizes risk reduction under limited patching hours

## Problem

Security teams face hundreds of vulnerabilities but have limited patching resources.
This system helps prioritize patches by balancing risk impact and operational constraints.

## Planned Features

- Synthetic vulnerability dataset generation
- Risk regression model (Random Forest)
- SHAP explainability (global & local)
- Patch prioritization using dynamic programming
- Streamlit interactive dashboard

## Status

Currently under development.
Architecture and modeling finalized. Implementation in progress.
